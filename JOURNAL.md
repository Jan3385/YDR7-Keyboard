## 10/28/2025 - Setup & research  

I have done some research about which devboard, switches etc to use. I also setup the github with KiCad and such. Mentally planned out where I want what, which features should the keyboard have and which not

## 10/29/2025 1 PM - Designed the schematic and searched for parts  

I made the (maybe) final schematic for my keyboard. The number of switches and LEDs will probably go down as I am not yet totally sure how much will I need but thats about it. I have put a 128x128 OLED display on the keyboard along with an RGB LED below each key of the keyboard so it should be looking (and working) pretty good once finished

I also tried to find all the parts that I will yet need from aliexpress and similar. I have not found all of them but most

Also I looked somewhat onto how to code the firmware later on and such which I am planning to do in C++ and have a custom interactible menu on the OLED along with some animations etc
  

## 10/29/2025 6 PM - Started making the PCB  

Started making the PCB, mainly the keys and their diodes. I will have to remake the schematic for the keys since it doesnt fit well with how I ended up placing them on the PCB

ALso improved on the schematic like adding pull-up resistors for the I2C for display communication and such

## 11/1/2025 1 AM - Finished the wiring of the PCB  

I wired up all the LEDs and buttons on the PCB along with resistors etc. At first I had a lot of errors to go through but most of them were fixed by just changing the tolerances and stitching the PCB

After stitching the PCB, changing tolerances etc I had 0 errors (whe warnings are mostly fine as its just isolated copper fills)

I am not totally done with the PCB as I will have to check if everything actually works etc but it should be done for the most part  

## 11/1/2025 9 PM - Basic Firmware  

I have written a basic firmware for the keyboard where I mapped all the pins and made it write the letter "A" on loop as a keyboard. I have written it in C++ since its more fun and probably gives more control than for ex. Python. I was focusing on making the firmware basics easy to modify and configure

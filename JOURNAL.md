## 10/28/2025 - Setup & research  

I have done some research about which devboard, switches etc to use. I also setup the github with KiCad and such. Mentally planned out where I want what, which features should the keyboard have and which not

## 10/29/2025 - Designed the schematic and searched for parts  

I made the (maybe) final schematic for my keyboard. The number of switches and LEDs will probably go down as I am not yet totally sure how much will I need but thats about it. I have put a 128x128 OLED display on the keyboard along with an RGB LED below each key of the keyboard so it should be looking (and working) pretty good once finished

I also tried to find all the parts that I will yet need from aliexpress and similar. I have not found all of them but most

Also I looked somewhat onto how to code the firmware later on and such which I am planning to do in C++ and have a custom interactible menu on the OLED along with some animations etc
